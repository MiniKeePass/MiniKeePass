        <h1>Using Key Files</h1>
        
        <p>MiniKeePass can open KeePass 1.x/2.x files that use a key file instead of or in addition to a password.</p>
        
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Load your KeePass database and key file in MiniKeePass using iTunes, Dropbox, etc.</li>
            <li>Open your KeePass file in MiniKeePass</li>
            <li>When prompted for your password you can enter a password and/or select a key file</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Note: MiniKeePass will automatically select your key file if it has the same filename as your KeePass file but with a .key extension.<p>
