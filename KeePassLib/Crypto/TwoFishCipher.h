 * you work on. If you have a multi-platform program, you no doubt have 
 * portable definitions that you can substitute here without changing 
 * the rest of the code.
 *
 * The defaults provided here should work on most PC compilers.

 * This structure contains the internal form. It is rather large: 4256 bytes
 * on a platform with 32-bit unsigned values.

 * Treat this as an opague structure, and don't try to manipulate the
 * elements in it. I wish I could hide the inside of the structure,

/*
 * Convert a cipher key to the internal form used for 
 * encryption and decryption.
 * 
 * The cipher key is an array of bytes; the Twofish_Byte type is 
 * defined above to a type suitable on your platform. 
 *
 * Any key must be converted to an internal form in the Twofisk_key structure
 * before it can be used.
 * The encryption and decryption functions only work with the internal form.
 * The conversion to internal form need only be done once for each key value.
 *
 * Be sure to wipe all key storage, including the Twofish_key structure, 
 * once you are done with the key data. 
 * A simple memset( TwofishKey, 0, sizeof( TwofishKey ) ) will do just fine.
 *
 * Unlike most implementations, this one allows any key size from 0 bytes 
 * to 32 bytes. According to the Twofish specifications, 
 * irregular key sizes are handled by padding the key with zeroes at the end 
 * until the key size is 16, 24, or 32 bytes, whichever
 * comes first. Note that each key of irregular size is equivalent to exactly
 * one key of 16, 24, or 32 bytes.
 *
 * WARNING: Short keys have low entropy, and result in low security.
 * Anything less than 8 bytes is utterly insecure. For good security
 * use at least 16 bytes. I prefer to use 32-byte keys to prevent
 * any collision attacks on the key.
 *
 * The key length argument key_len must be in the proper range.
 * If key_len is not in the range 0,...,32 this routine attempts to generate 
 * a fatal error (depending on the code environment), 
 * and at best (or worst) returns without having done anything.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * key      Array of key bytes
 * key_len  Number of key bytes, must be in the range 0,1,...,32. 
 * xkey     Pointer to an Twofish_key structure that will be filled 
 *             with the internal form of the cipher key.
